## Detail Design

- User Input Preview: Provides a real-time preview of the content being entered; inspired by NextChat.

- Code Paste Optimization: When pasting code copied from VSCode into the input box, it is automatically wrapped in a markdown code block and the language is indicated.

- Text File Support: Supports directly adding text-type files (code, CSV, etc.) to the user input, and the file content and file name will be part of the user input. Compared to manually pasting the file content into the input box, this method is faster and the file content does not take up display space.

- Paste: Through Ctrl + V paste, you can paste text, images, and files; in addition, when pasting text outside the input box, it will be used as an independent text block, like a text file.

- Quote: After dragging and selecting the content of the conversation message with the mouse, click "Quote" to quote the content in the user input. This function is equivalent to a shortcut to manually copy the message content and paste it into the input box, which is convenient for asking targeted follow-up questions about part of the assistant's answer.

- Quick Scroll: There is a quick scroll button in the lower right corner of the conversation. In addition to general scrolling to the top/bottom, the middle two buttons are for scrolling aligned to the beginning/end of the message or the previous/next message, which is very convenient when the message is long.

- Keyboard Control: Keyboard control: Supports setting keyboard shortcuts to trigger the above scrolling operations, as well as using keyboard shortcuts to switch message chains, regenerate, and create new conversations.
